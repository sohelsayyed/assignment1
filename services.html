	<pre style="color:white">No two organizations have security needs that are exactly alike. Therefore <i>

	DELTA SECURITY </i>focuses on integrated and   adaptive services that are customized 

    and specially tailored for each job. In addition to our security practices and  

    customer service, we integrate the best personnel, training, and technology into our

     work, allowing us to build strong  and meaningful client relationships.  We begin 

    by taking the time to understand each of our clientsâ€™ particular needs.Then, we create 

    a robust security solution that not only meets those needs, but proactively anticipates 

    for any potential issues. Ultimately, our solutions enable our security professionals to 

    prepare for and respond to risk more  effectively. As a result, we provide our clients 

    with transparency, peace of mind, and a proactive security system that can be trusted.</pre>
